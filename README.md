A full-stack ride-hailing prototype that demonstrates core ride-sharing features: user authentication, driver discovery, real-time ride updates, and booking flow. QuickRide is split into frontend and backend folders for a clear separation of concerns and easy local development.

Key features

User and driver flows (signup / login, request rides, accept rides)

Ride creation and matching (simple passenger → driver flow)

Real-time updates for ride status and driver location (socket/websocket or polling)

Geo / map integration for selecting pickup and dropoff points (UI shows route and ETA)

Persistent data storage for users, drivers, and rides (configurable DB)

Development scripts for running frontend and backend concurrently
